Here is my basic portfolio. There are still many projects to be added but feel free to look around and run each program. The JavaScript folder contains a "hello-web-gl-again.html" that will load a canvas element with an approximation of a sphere. Most of this code was adapted from my professor and Edward Angel however the code for the sphere body and poles was ported to JavaScript by myself. With that being said, enjoy my portfolio and feel free to contact me at athontz@gmail.com
